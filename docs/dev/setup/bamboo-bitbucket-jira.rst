Setup for Programming Exercises with Bamboo, Bitbucket and Jira
===============================================================

This page describes how to set up a programming exercise environment
based on Bamboo, Bitbucket and Jira.

| Please note that this setup will create a deployment that is very
  similiar to the one used in production but has one difference:
| In production, the builds are performed within Docker containers that
  are created by Bamboo (or its build agents). As we run Bamboo in a
  Docker container in this setup, creating new Docker containers within
  that container is not recommended (e.g. see `this
  article <https://itnext.io/docker-in-docker-521958d34efd>`__). There
  are some solution where one can pass the Docker socket to the Bamboo
  container, but none of these approachs work quite well here as Bamboo
  uses mounted directories that cause issues.

Therefore, a check is included within the BambooBuildPlanService that
ensures that builds are not started in Docker agents if the development
setup is present.

**Prerequisites:**

* `Docker <https://docs.docker.com/install>`__
* `Docker-Compose <https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/>`__

Docker-Compose
--------------

Before you start the docker-compose, check if the bamboo version in the
``build.gradle`` (search for ``com.atlassian.bamboo:bamboo-specs``) is
equal to the bamboo version number in the Dockerfile of bamboo stored in
``src/main/docker/bamboo/Dockerfile``. If the version number is not
equal adjust the version number in the Dockerfile.

Execute the docker-compose file ``atlassian.yml`` stored in
``src/main/docker`` e.g. with
``docker-compose -f src/main/docker/atlassian.yml up -d``

Error Handling: It can happen that there is an overload with other
docker networks
``ERROR: Pool overlaps with other one on this address space``. Use the
command ``docker network prune`` to resolve this issue.

Configure Bamboo, Bitbucket and Jira
------------------------------------

By default, the Jira instance is reachable under ``localhost:8081``, the
Bamboo instance under ``localhost:8085`` and the Bitbucket instance
under ``localhost:7990``.

**Get evaluation licenses for Atlassian products:** `Atlassian Licenses <https://my.atlassian.com/license/evaluation>`__

1. Create an admin user with the same credentials in all 3 applications.
   Create a sample project in Jira. Also, you can select the
   evaluation/internal/test/dev setups if you are asked. Select a
   ``Bitbucket (Server)`` license if asked. Do not connect Bitbucket
   with Jira yet.

2. | Execute the shell script ``atlassian-setup.sh`` in the
     ``src/main/docker`` directory (e.g. with
     ``src/main/docker/./atlassian-setup.sh``). This script creates
     groups, users ([STRIKEOUT:and adds them to the created groups] NOT
     YET) and disabled application links between the 3 applications

3. Enable the created `application
   links <https://confluence.atlassian.com/doc/linking-to-another-application-360677690.html>`__
   between all 3 application (OAuth Impersonate). **You manually have to
   adjust the Display URL for the Bamboo → Bitbucket AND
   Bitbucket → Bamboo URl to** ``http://localhost:7990`` **and**
   ``http://localhost:8085`` **.**

    **Bamboo:**

    .. figure:: bamboo-bitbucket-jira/bamboo_bitbucket_applicationLink.png
       :align: center

       Bamboo → Bitbucket

    .. figure:: bamboo-bitbucket-jira/bamboo_jira_applicationLink.png
       :align: center

       Bamboo → Jira


    **Bitbucket:**

    .. figure:: bamboo-bitbucket-jira/bitbucket_bamboo_applicationLink.png
       :align: center

       Bitbucket → Bamboo

    .. figure:: bamboo-bitbucket-jira/bitbucket_jira_applicationLink.png
       :align: center

       Bitbucket → Jira

    **Jira:**

    .. figure:: bamboo-bitbucket-jira/jira_bamboo_applicationLink.png
       :align: center

       Jira → Bamboo

    .. figure:: bamboo-bitbucket-jira/jira_bitbucket_applicationLink.png
       :align: center

       Jira → Bitbucket

4. The script has already created users and groups but you need to
   manually assign the users into their respective group in Jira. In our
   test setup, users 1-5 are students, 6-10 are tutors and 11-15 are
   instructors. The usernames are artemis_test_user_{1-15} and the
   password is again the username. When you create a course in artemis
   you have to manually choose the created groups(students, tutors,
   instructors).

5. Use the `user directories in
   Jira <https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/allowing-connections-to-jira-for-user-management-938847045.html>`__
   to synchronize the users in bitbucket and bamboo:

-  Go to Jira → User management → Jira user server → Add application →
   Create one application for bitbucket and one for bamboo → add the
   IP-address ``0.0.0.0/0`` to IP Addresses

    .. figure:: bamboo-bitbucket-jira/jira_add_application.png
       :align: center


-  Go to Bitbucket and Bamboo → User Directories → Add Directories →
   Atlassian Crowd → use the URL ``http://jira:8080`` as Server URL →
   use the application name and password which you used in the previous
   step. Also, you should decrease the synchronisation period (e.g. to 2
   minutes). Press synchronise after adding the directory, the users and
   groups should now be available.

    .. figure:: bamboo-bitbucket-jira/user_directories.png
       :align: center

6. In Bamboo create a global variable named
SERVER_PLUGIN_SECRET_PASSWORD, the value of this variable will be used
as the secret. The value of this variable should be then stored in
``src/main/resources/config/application-artemis.yml`` as the value of
``artemis-authentication-token-value``.

7. Download the
`bamboo-server-notifaction-plugin <https://github.com/ls1intum/bamboo-server-notification-plugin/releases>`__
and add it to bamboo. Go to Bamboo → Manage apps → Upload app → select
the downloaded .jar file → Upload

8. Add Maven and JDK:

-  Go to Bamboo → Server capabilities → Add capabilities menu →
   Capability type ``Executable`` → select type ``Maven 3.x`` → insert
   ``Maven 3`` as executable label → insert ``/artemis`` as path.

-  Add capabilities menu → Capability type ``JDK`` → insert ``JDK 12``
   as JDK label → insert ``/usr/lib/jvm/java-14-oracle`` as Java home.

Configure Artemis
-----------------

1. Modify ``src/main/resources/config/application-artemis.yml``

.. code:: yaml

           repo-clone-path: ./repos/
           repo-download-clone-path: ./repos-download/
           encryption-password: artemis-encrypt     # arbitrary password for encrypting database values
           user-management:
               use-external: true
               external:
                   url: http://localhost:8081
                   user:  <jira-admin-user>
                   password: <jira-admin-password>
                   admin-group-name: instructors
               internal-admin:
                   username: artemis_admin
                   password: artemis_admin            
           version-control:
               url: http://localhost:7990
               user:  <bitbucket-admin-user>
               password: <bitbuckt-admin-password>
           continuous-integration:
               url: http://localhost:8085
               user:  <bamboo-admin-user>
               password: <bamboo-admin-password>
               vcs-application-link-name: LS1 Bitbucket Server
               empty-commit-necessary: true
               artemis-authentication-token-value: <artemis-authentication-token-value>

2. Modify the application-dev.yml

.. code:: yaml

   server:
       port: 8080                                         # The port of artemis
       url: http://172.20.0.1:8080                        # needs to be an ip

In addition, you have to start Artemis with the profiles ``bamboo``,
``bitbucket`` and ``jira`` so that the correct adapters will be used,
e.g.:

::

   --spring.profiles.active=dev,bamboo,bitbucket,jira,artemis

Please read :doc:`../setup` for more details.
