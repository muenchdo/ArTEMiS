/**
 * @author Stephan Krusche (krusche@in.tum.de)
 * @version 3.0 (25.09.2019)
 *
 * This class scans the submission project if the current expected class is actually
 * present in it or not. The result is returned as an instance of ScanResult.
 * The ScanResult consists of a ScanResultType and a ScanResultMessage as a string.
 * ScanResultType is an enum and is implemented so that identifying just the type of
 * the error and the binding of several messages to a certain result is possible.
 *
 * There are the following possible results:
 * - The class has the correct name and is placed in the correct package.
 * - The class has the correct name but is misplaced.
 * - The class name has wrong casing, but is placed in the correct package.
 * - The class name has wrong casing and is misplaced.
 * - The class name has typos, but is placed in the correct package.
 * - The class name has typos and is misplaced.
 * - The class name has too many typos, thus is declared as not found.
 * - Undefined, which is used to initialize the scan result.
 *
 *  A note on the limit of allowed number of typos: the maximal number depends
 *  on the length of the class name and is defined as ceiling(classNameLength / 4).
